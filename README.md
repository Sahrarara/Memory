# Memory
vanilla javascript memory game

A little memory game to show off my skills in html, css and vanilla javascript.

Simply click on a red square and it shows you one of the signs below.
It counts the moves (for every two squares clicked, it adds one move)
There is a little score calculator as well.
A timer is made only in javascript and only shows in the console. (Access the console by pressing f12 and click on the console tab)
